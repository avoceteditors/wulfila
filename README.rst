``wulfila`` is polyglottal.  It will provide reference for several languages and possibly some conlangs, but currently it does not support any.

Planned Languages
===================

This is the probable order in which languages will be introduced, based on the author's current priorities:

* Old Saxon
* Old High German
* Old Norse
* Old English
* Gothic
* Latin
* Classical Greek

Meaning in the Name
***********************

𐍅𐌿𐌻𐍆𐌹𐌻𐌰 was a fourth century bishop and missionary who produced a translation of the Bible from Greek into the now extinct East Germanic language of Gothic.  The Wulfila Bible today represents the overwhelming majority of surviving Gothic text, so it's a frequent subject of study for anyone interested in Germanic philology.

Much of the tool was planned out while the author was translating Gothic texts for a course in Germanic philology.  It's current lower position is due to the class moving on to Old Saxon before the tool was usable.  The Gothic name stuck in spite of this because it sounds cool.

***************
Lexicon?
***************

In the future, this tool may include a lexicon.  Such implementation would depend on the availability of public domain source material and the time to re-encode the source into XML.
